# Mark And Learn

This is a chrome extension that helps you with creating and learning a glossary.

Let's say that your native language is English and that you want to learn Spanish.
One popular way of learning a new language is to read a lot of texts in that language, news for instance. The Mark And Learn extension makes it easy to save words and their translation into a glossary in the browser. All you need to do is to highlight the word and save it, the word will then be translated and stored in the glossary for you to later practice.
